# Installation

```bash
brew install ludovicianul/tap/sol
```

There are binaries available for Linux and macOS as well as cross-platform `uberjar`. You can download them from the [releases page](https://github.com/ludovicianul/sol/releases)

# How to use sol?

## Pre-requisites - OpenAI or Anthropic API key

Sol uses by default the OpenAI API to generate responses to your questions. You need to have an API key to use it.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

You can also use the Anthropic API instead. To do so, you need to set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Prerequisites - Indexing your git history

Before being able to query data from your git history, you need to index it. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
sol --index
```

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://github.com/ludovicianul/sol/blob/9e2479709â€¦8cf2a91d14fdc45ba7e05b0/images/index.gif?raw=true">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://github.com/ludovicianul/sol/blob/9e2479709â€¦8cf2a91d14fdc45ba7e05b0/images/index.gif?raw=true">

</picture>

This will create a `.sol` directory at the root of your repository and store the necessary data to query your git history.

## Querying your git history

Once the indexing is done, you can start querying your git history. Here are a few examples:

```bash
sol -q "What is the average time between commits?"
```

```bash
sol -q "Calculate the bus factor for all developers"
```
